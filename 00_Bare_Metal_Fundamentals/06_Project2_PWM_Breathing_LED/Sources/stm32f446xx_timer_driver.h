 * Description:
 * Header file for TIM (Hardware Timer) Driver.
 *
 * Why Hardware Timer?
 * 1. Efficiency: Software delay (busy-wait loops) wastes CPU cycles, blocking other tasks.
 * Hardware timers operate independently of the CPU core.
 * 2. Precision: Hardware timers provide precise timing determined by the system clock,
 * whereas software delay duration varies with compiler optimization and code execution.
 * 3. PWM Generation: This driver handles PWM signal generation for the breathing LED project.

 * ==========================================
 * 1. Peripheral Clock Setup
 * ==========================================
 * Must be called FIRST before using any Timer.
 * 'EnableOrDisable' should be ENABLE or DISABLE macros.
 * TIM2 is connected to APB1 Bus (offset 0x00) according to memory map in RM0390 manual
 * thus, we need to access RCC_APB1ENR (APB1 peripheral clock enable register)
 * Bit 0 sets TIM2
 * 0: TIM2 clock disabled
 * 1: TIM2 clock enabled

/*
 * TIM Configuration Structure
 * This structure acts as the "Menu" for user-configurable settings.
 *
 * [Design Decision Note]
 * For the "Breathing LED" project, this structure is intentionally simplified.
 * It abstracts away the complexity of specific register bits that don't need
 * to change for this specific application.
 *
 * Exposed Settings:
 * 1. Prescaler (PSC): Controls the "Speed" of the timer tick.
 * 2. Period (ARR): Controls the "Frequency" of the PWM cycle.
 *
 * Hidden Settings (Hardcoded in Driver):
 * - PWM Mode (CCMR1): Fixed to PWM Mode 1.
 * - Output Enable (CCER): Always enabled for Channel 1.
 * - Counter Enable (CR1): Always turned on after init.
 *
 * Why not CCR1?
 * The Capture/Compare Register (CCR1) controls duty cycle (brightness).
 * Since brightness changes dynamically at runtime (in the while loop),
 * it is not part of the static initialization configuration.

/*
 * TIM Handle Structure
 * This structure acts as the "Object" or "Handle" for a specific Timer instance.
 * It bundles the Physical Hardware with User Configuration.
 *
 * Concept: "Job Order"
 * - "Where" to do the job: pTIMx (Base Address of the peripheral)
 * - "How" to do the job:   TIM_Config (User parameters)
